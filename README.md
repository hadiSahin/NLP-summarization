Automatic Summarization of City of Miami Commission Meeting

Abstract: 
Recent advances in Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) and machine learning have brought
about exciting new possibilities for utilizing
textual data in research. In this project, I delved
into the City of Miami Commission meetings
to extract the discussed topics and provide
summaries using NLP models. I utilize three
widely used pre-trained models, including Bidi-
rectional auto-regressive transformer (BART).
To improve the accuracy of the models, I fine-
tuned them with the extracted data. The results
were promising, with approximately 35% text
similarity with model-generated and human
made data. This study highlights the potential
of NLP and machine learning in uncovering
valuable information from textual data.
